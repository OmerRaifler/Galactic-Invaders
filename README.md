# Galactic-Invaders

A fun 2D pixel shooting game inspired by the original "Space Invaders" game.

Control your spaceship and shoot the aliens!

The game features two modes:

- solo: more slow-paced, you play alone with one spaceship.

- duo: fast-paced, two spaceships, you can play locally with your friend.


**Rules**

The game will end in one of two scenarios:
- Your health bar went down to zero
- 5 enemies successfully reached the bottom of the screen
